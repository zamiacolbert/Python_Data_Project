# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To identify the top skills in demand, I analyzed job postings from a dataset focused on data-related roles in the U.S. I filtered the data by the top 3 most popular job titles and visualized the five most frequently mentioned skills for each using horizontal bar plots. The visualizations show the likelihood of each skill appearing in job postings, helping highlight which technical abilities are most valued across roles such as Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist.

Here is the link to my notebook to see a detailed breakdown of the steps taken: [2_Skills_Demand.ipynb](3_Project\2_Skills_Demand.ipynb)


### Code

```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].get_legend().remove()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)


    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va='center')

    
    if i != len(job_titles) - 1: 
        ax[i].set_xticks([])

This reinforces **SQL's** fundamental importance for data analysis roles.

* **Excel ia a consistently important skill, but with fluctuations:** **Excel** consistently ranks as the second most requested skill. However, its demand showed more variability throughout the year, with a notable peak around July and August and then declining before rising again towards the end of the year.

* **Python and Tableau exhibit a generally upward trend:** Both **Python** and **Tableau** showed a tendency to be requested more frequently as the year progressed, suggesting their growing relevance in the Data Analyst skillset. **Tableau** showed a particularly noticeable increase in the later months.

* **Power BI shows relatively stable but lower demand:** **Power BI** consistently had the lowest likelihood of being requested among the skills presented, with relatively minor fluctuations throughout the year. **Power BI** generally remains in the 20-25% range.




## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To evaluate salary trends for U.S-based Data Analysts, I created visualizations to compare compensation across job titles and skills. A box plot displays salary distributions for the top 6 data roles, offering a clear view of pay ranges in the U.S. I also identified the top 10 highest-paying and top 10 most in-demand skills for Data Analysts in the United States, using bar charts to show how each skill correlates with median salary. This dual analysis helps highlight both lucrative and widely requested skills in the current job market.

Here is the link to my notebook to see a detailed breakdown of the steps taken: [.ipynb](3_Project\4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb)

### Salary Analysis :

### Code

```python

sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')


plt.title('Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlim(0, 600000) 
ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```

### Visualization
![Salary Distributions of Data Jobs in the US](3_Project\Images\salary_analysis_for_data_roles.png)
* This box plot shoes the salary distributions for the top 6 data roles.

### Insights

* **Salaries generally increase with seniority.** The graph shows a positive correlation exists between job level and salary; for instance, the Senior Data Scientists and Senior Data Engineers have higher median and overall salaries compared to their non-senior counterparts.

* **Data Science and Data Engineering roles tend to have higher salary potential.** For both senior and non-senior roles, the box plots for Data Scientist and Data Engineer positions are generally positioned higher on the salary scale compared to Data Analyst roles. This suggests that roles involving more advanced modeling, programming, and infrastructure responsibilities often command higher compensation. Â  

* **Significant salary overlap exists between different roles and seniority levels.** While the medians and overall distributions differ, there's a considerable overlap in the salary ranges between adjacent roles and seniority levels. For instance, some experienced Data Analysts might earn within the range of entry-level Data Scientists or Data Engineers. Similarly, the lower end of Senior Data Scientist salaries can overlap with the higher end of Data Scientist salaries.

* This bar chart shows the highest paid skills (top graph) and median salary for the most in-demand skills (bottom graph) for data analysts in the US.

### Insights

* **A disconnect between highest paid and most in-demand:** There's a significant difference between the skills that command the highest salaries and those that are most frequently sought after. The highly paid skills are more niche and specialized, while the most in-demand skills are the foundational tools of data analysis.

* **Traditional data analysis tools dominate in-demand skills:** The most in-demand skills are those commonly associated with core data analysis tasks: "python," "tableau," "r," "sql server," "sql," "sas," "power bi," and "excel."

* **Microsoft products occupy 5 out of the top 10 most in-demand skills for Data Analysts**, including SQL Server, Power BI, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word.
